# Example Snippet 1

This would normally explain what this snippet does, and how to use it.

In this version, we're supporting two engine versions that require different code but where the snippet has feature parity. See v2A for legacy support. We also remove a lot of functionality to shrink the file size.

We assume that `module.exports` has been removed in engine version 0.5.0 and replaced with ES6 modules.

## Supported engine versions

0.5.0
